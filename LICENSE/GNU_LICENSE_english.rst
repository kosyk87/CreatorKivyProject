Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this License document, but changing it is not allowed.

[color=#9e6e47ff]Preamble
-------------------------

[color=#a6b4bcff]The [color=#9e6e47ff]Licenses[color=#a6b4bcff] for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the [color=#9e6e47ff]GNU General
Public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] [color=#a6b4bcff]is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
[color=#9e6e47ff]General Public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] [color=#a6b4bcff]applies to most of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Free Software
Foundation's [color=#a6b4bcff]software and to any other [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other [color=#9e6e47ff]Free Software Foundation [color=#a6b4bcff]software is covered by
the [color=#9e6e47ff]GNU Lesser General Public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] [color=#a6b4bcff]instead.)  You can apply it to
your [color=#9e6e47ff]Programs[color=#a6b4bcff], too.

[color=#a6b4bcff]When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our [color=#9e6e47ff]General Public [color=#9e6e47ff]Licenses[color=#a6b4bcff] [color=#a6b4bcff]are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free [color=#9e6e47ff]Programs[color=#a6b4bcff]; and that you know you can do these things.

[color=#a6b4bcff]To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

[color=#a6b4bcff]For example, if you distribute copies of such a [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff], whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

[color=#9e6e47ff]We protect your rights with two steps:
-------------------------------------------------------

#. [color=#9e6e47ff](1) [color=#a6b4bcff]copyright the software
#. [color=#9e6e47ff](2) [color=#a6b4bcff]offer you this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] which gives
   you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

[color=#a6b4bcff]Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

[color=#a6b4bcff]Finally, any free [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
[color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] will individually obtain patent [color=#9e6e47ff]Licenses[color=#a6b4bcff], in effect making the
[color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be [color=#9e6e47ff]Licensed[color=#a6b4bcff] for everyone's free use or not [color=#9e6e47ff]Licensed[color=#a6b4bcff] at all.

[color=#a6b4bcff]The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

[color=#9e6e47ff]TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]This [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] applies to any [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or other work which contains
   a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this [color=#9e6e47ff]General Public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].  [color=#a6b4bcff]The "[color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]", below,
   refers to any such [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or work, and a "work based on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]"
   means either the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
   language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification".)  Each [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]e is addressed as "you".

    [color=#a6b4bcff]Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]; they are outside
    its scope.  The act of running the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is not restricted,
    and the output from the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] (independent of having been made by running the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]).
    Whether that is true depends on what the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] does.

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program's[color=#a6b4bcff]
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] and to the absence of any warranty;
   and give any other recipients of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] a copy of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]
   along with the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff].

    [color=#a6b4bcff]You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]You may modify your copy or copies of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff], and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    [color=#a6b4bcff]You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    [color=#a6b4bcff]You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or any
    part thereof, to be [color=#9e6e47ff]Licensed[color=#a6b4bcff] as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].

    [color=#a6b4bcff]If the modified [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].  (Exception: if the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is not required to print an announcement.)

    [color=#a6b4bcff]These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff],
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff], and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff], the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff], whose permissions for other [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]es extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    [color=#a6b4bcff]Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff].

    [color=#a6b4bcff]In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]
    with the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] (or with a work based on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]You may copy and distribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]
   (or a work based on it, under Section [color=#9e6e47ff]2) [color=#a6b4bcff]in object code or executable
   form under the terms of Sections [color=#9e6e47ff]1[color=#a6b4bcff] and [color=#9e6e47ff]2[color=#a6b4bcff] above provided that you also do one of the following:

      [color=#a6b4bcff]Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      [color=#a6b4bcff]Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
      customarily used for software interchange; or,

      [color=#a6b4bcff]Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
      received the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] in object code or executable form with such
      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
   code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
   associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
   control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
   special exception, the source code distributed need not include
   anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
   form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
   operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
   itself accompanies the executable.

     [color=#a6b4bcff]If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]You may not copy, modify, sub[color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff],
   or distribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]
   except as expressly provided under this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].  Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sub[color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] or distribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].
   However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
   this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] will not have their [color=#9e6e47ff]Licenses[color=#a6b4bcff] terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]You are not required to accept this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff], since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] (or any work based on the
   [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]), you indicate your acceptance of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] or works based on it.

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]Each time you redistribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]
   (or any work based on the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]), the
   recipient automatically receives a [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] subject to
   these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff], they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] at all.
   For example, if a patent [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff].

    [color=#a6b4bcff]If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.

    [color=#a6b4bcff]It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] practices. Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]e cannot
    impose that choice.

    [color=#a6b4bcff]This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]If the distribution and/or use of the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] under this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]
   may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
   those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
   countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] incorporates
   the limitation as if written in the body of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff].

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the General Public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] from time to time.  Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
   address new problems or concerns.

    [color=#a6b4bcff]Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff]
    specifies a version number of this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff] which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] does not specify a version number of
    this [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff], you may choose any version ever published by the [color=#9e6e47ff]Free Software
    Foundation.

#. [color=#a6b4bcff]If you wish to incorporate parts of the 
   [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] into other free
   [color=#9e6e47ff]Programs[color=#a6b4bcff] whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
   to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
   Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
   make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
   of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
   of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

[color=#9e6e47ff]NO WARRANTY
----------------------------

[color=#a6b4bcff]BECAUSE THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] IS
[color=#9e6e47ff]Licensed[color=#a6b4bcff] FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff], TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
[color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

[color=#a6b4bcff]IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
[color=#9e6e47ff]Programs[color=#a6b4bcff]), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


[color=#9e6e47ff]END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
--------------------------------------------

[color=#a6b4bcff]How to Apply These Terms to Your New [color=#9e6e47ff]Programs[color=#a6b4bcff]

[color=#a6b4bcff]If you develop a new [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff], and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

[color=#a6b4bcff]To do so, attach the following notices to the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff].  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

[color=#a6b4bcff]one line to give the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program's[color=#a6b4bcff] name and an idea of what it does.

[color=#a6b4bcff]You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public [color=#9e6e47ff]License[color=#a6b4bcff]

[color=#a6b4bcff]Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

[color=#a6b4bcff]If the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff] is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

`show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff].

[color=#a6b4bcff]You should also get your employer (if you work as a [color=#9e6e47ff]Programmer[color=#a6b4bcff]) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the [color=#9e6e47ff]Program[color=#a6b4bcff], if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
